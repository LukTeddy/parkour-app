# Parkour Map

This website allows users to interact with other users, add spots, media and challenges. People can create accounts and add spots that they enjoy visiting within Adelaide to the map. This is a passion project of mine that allows me to interact with other individuals who love the same sport as me.

## How I Created This:
**Technology Used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Django, Linode/Akamai, Python

In this project, I utilised the Django framework to develop a full featured website with multiple sections for user interaction. Using Django I was able to create a home site, providing quick and simple linking access to major areas of the website. I also used Django's template view system I was able to display different aspects of the website using HTML documents as well as handle user requests with forms and post methods. 

Using Django's models I was able to effictively manipulate data. I was able to utilise HTML and CSS to create important website aspects and allow for easy user interaction, and I was able to use leaflet.js to display interactive maps and spot locations.

Deploying my website required both the functionality of Linode for server hosting which ensured scalability and reliability. I also created a custom domain using NameCheap.com to make it more accessible.

## Optimisations
_Future development will be described here._

## Lessons Learned:
During the creation of this project I learned quite a bit about HTML and CSS and how they interact with each other.

I also learnt how to deploy a website and the consequences of deploying certain aspects. 

I spent quite a while learning how to build, update and delete data and how servers handle that data.

I am hoping to work more on web development within the future, and will hopefully be regularly updating this project in

the future to make it accessible to all users, optimised and complete to my and users' satisfaction. Thank You.
